this a fork from [Saudi-Arabia-Regions-Cities-and-Districts](https://github.com/homaily/Saudi-Arabia-Regions-Cities-and-Districts). I just rearranged cities to be based on region which was already there but wasn't in tree based structure (I think its better for my case and also its better for IO so I don't have to iterate though all cities every time).

### My Case:
I've a dropdown of Saudi cities which I needed them to be shown based on selected region.

big thanks to @homaily.
